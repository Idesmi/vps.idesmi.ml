			Hi.
		</p>
		<p>
			This page should contain Waifus in the future, but I'm not really sure how I feel about making it atm.
		</p>
		<p>
			First thing first though,
		</p>
		<p>
			What's a <del>computer</del> Waifu?
		</p>
		<p>
			According to the
			<a
				href=https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Waifu
			>
				Urban Dictionary<!--
			--></a>, 
			<blockquote>
				the term "waifu" is used to refer to a fictional girl or woman (usually in Anime, Manga, or video-games) that you have sexual attraction to, and you would even marry.
			</blockquote>
		</p>
		<p>		
			This is obviously the first entry, as UB is not shy in providing much more meaningful insights. Ol' good internet vocabulary.
		</p>
		<p>
			The second source of our renewed knowledge would be 
			<a
				href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/waifu"
			>
				Know Your Meme<!--
			--></a>,
			which reads, in a behaved tone:
			<blockquote>
				[...] the term has been [] adopted by Otaku circles and anime fans to refer to one's favorite female manga or anime character.
			</blockquote>
		</p>
		<p>
			If you're embarassed at the idea of linking or even falling in love with a fictional character, then this second definition definitely is the only one you should read.
